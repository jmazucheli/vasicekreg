Description: Provides probability density, cumulative distribution,
    quantile, and random number generation functions for the Vasicek
    distribution. In addition, two functions are available for fitting

    by Rigby and Stasinopoulos (2005,
    <doi:10.1111/j.1467-9876.2005.00510.x>). Some functions are written in
    'C++' using 'Rcpp', developed by Eddelbuettel and Francois (2011,
